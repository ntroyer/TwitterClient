Twitter Client

How to run: Open TwitterTwits.xcodeproj in xcode and run the project.

What it does:

Displays a list of accounts the user is following based on the latest tweets from these users

You can touch one of the cells to view the latest tweets from that user.  From there, you can touch one
of the tweet cells to open up a web browser that navigates to any links included in the tweet.

The map tab gets the location of each of the users on a map, if available.  From there, you can select
one of the pins on the map and open a list of the appropriate user's tweets.
